## ðŸœ‚ About Me
I explore the intersections of Linux environments, Android internals, and automation.  
My work lives in the space between the expected and the unconventionalâ€”  
where proot-distro, Termux, and system-level tooling become a single, fluid workspace.

I prefer workflows that are:
- Minimal yet powerful  
- Quietly efficient  
- Built with intention  
- Tuned for privacy, resilience, and aesthetic cohesion  

---

## ðŸœ What I Build
- Hybrid Androidâ€“Linux development environments  
- Automated pipelines that feel like magic  
- Clean, reliable build systems  
- Tools that dissolve friction instead of adding to it  

---

## ðŸœƒ Current Focus
- Integrating privileged operations into rootless environments  
- Streamlining Gradle, Java, and SSH workflows on mobile  
- Designing terminals that look as good as they feel  
- Turning complex setups into repeatable, elegant systems
